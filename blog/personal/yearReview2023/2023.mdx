## Reading Materials this year WIP
This year I have been extremely bad at keeping track of my readings! This is due to the fact that most of my reading has been articles and newsletter online. I will be looking into a way to capture my reading material in a user friendly way.
To force myself to go back to reading books I joined our work's book club and read [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299).

## Month by month highlights
### January
This year did not start on a good note... confirming the pattern. We had a planned major infrastucture upgrade for CourseKey that causes down time and required AWS's involvement and coordenation. Although, things went very smoothly on our end, AWS broke things and thier communication was terrible since it was literally hours into the new year. Because of that had to go in reset the systems manually and rebuild two replication servers. We barely managed to have everything up and running right before the end of the maintencen window we communicated to the

I got to enjoy an awesome disney on ice show with the family. Although it was meant for kids, I did enjoy it and was a nice and refreshing for what was about to come.

San Fransico was the first travel destination, it is always nice to travel however it was rough this time. The reason for that was because had to review the hard dicisions we made and pull the trigger on them. For me, that meant letting go of almost half of my engineering team! Eventhough, I knew about what needed to be done it was still not an easy thing to do. 

### February
My mom's feet/legs werent doing so well, while we continued to go to doctors and get it addressed, her dentures no longer were working. In addition to all of those issues, her remaining teeth were in a very bad shape. Because of all of that, we decided to do an all on four denture implant.

Work has been rough due to not having half the team! Additionally, the Cortex project that was deployed by a team that was eliminated was incomplete and implemented incorrectly. That meant, we had to redo and fix different parts of it.

I checkedout the LinkUp meetup in town which was fun. Got to checkout the WeWork cowroking space and meet some cool people.

I also finally managed to fit my workouts into my schedule since my doctor pretty much gave me a lecutre how I am being unhealthy.

### March
Most of this month was spent focused on fixing Cortex especially since we learned there were more problems than we originally thought. We pretty much had to rebuild the entire product (Cortex).

I did take a day to change things up and recharge a bit. I got to help prep for a surprise party for the preist's birthday party, attend fancy dinner with firends and attend the party all in one day!

### April
We mostly wrapped up all the Cortex fixes and re-released it! Things finally started to calm down a bit so it was time to catch up on everything else that I had been pushing of.

Given it was spring and the weather is nice there were alot of events going on in town. We started with 626 Night Market which was awesome and filled with bunch of street food, sadly it was very pricy! Then we checked out the Anime night market which was fun and made me realize how far behind I was on anime :(.

Of course that was not all, we attended an easter party hosted by the church which was fun. Additionally, I attended ISA International sign Expo where I saw the biggest printers ever and all sorts of signs!

All of that was not even half of the month yet. I had a trip to San Diego to attended my friend's engagement party and catch up with friends and family. That trip also included a mini trip to LA with some relatives.

It has been a long time since been to a concert. I ended up going to the WeBridge festival which was amazing. Got to see multiple Korean pop bands and singers perform live over two days. It was a great experience and I am glad I went. I got to discover some incredible artists.

Then I went back again to San Diego! This time was to attend and present at the advance conference. It was a great experience and I got to meet some cool people. While I was there I also got to catch up with more of my friends. The conference included a day across the border in Mexico where I got to visit and experience the wineries of Valle de Guadalupe.

My trip to San Diego wasn't over yet! I was on the review panel for the ZIP Lunchpad and attended the graduation party. And before calling it a trip, I went on a hile with my coworkers who still lived in San Diego.

Since this month wasn't busy enough, I decided to squeeze in one last big thing to make up for the rough first quarter of the year. I attended a communion party which was fun.

### May

Started the month with a bang! We found out about [Imaginarium](https://imaginarium360.com) attraction which was really nice! Got to enjoy a bunch of lights and art installations. It was a great experience and had ton of fun taking pictures with the family.

I also learned that there was a pickup soccer game near by. Every Tuesday that I am in town I go to play with some friends and get some good cardio in.

Being in Vegas, means there is always something to do. We attended the Las Vegas Science Expo which was fun even though it was designed for kids. 

Since my sister is getting married, we went to San Diego to do thier photoshoot. That meant I got to hangout with my firends, get a few professional pictures of me and go on a date.

Being in Vegas means there are a ton of hotels and casions that we can explore. We stayed at Paris casion and got to enjoy some of the resturants there and explore it.

### June

With the summer heat and being in the desert we decided to go to a water park. We went to Cowabunga Bay which was fun and had a bunch of slides. It was a nice way to cool off before going back to San Diego.

This time the trip to San Diego was strictly to hangout with firends and go on dates. It was a nice trip and good change of pace from the busy life in Vegas and work chaos.

I didn't only go on dates in San Diego, I also went on a date in Vegas. Before heading out to Kansas city for CECU conference. I went to Kansas city a day early to explore the city abit and experience the BBQ and what it has to offer. The conference was great and I got to catch up with coworkers and meet some cool new people. While I was there I attended a couple of parties and have some more fun.

### July

Started the month with by raising the tempurature! My family and I went to Phoeniox Arizona and met with our relatives there for a fun weekend. Later we explored Laughlin and BullHead cities to escape Vegas's heat and enjoy the river a bit.

Since it was summer that meant it was time to enjoy some movies with friends. I not only got to watch a few movies but also got to watch them before everyone else since I got invited to a few prescreenings.

Additionally, I had a few friends visit from San Diego. We got to hangout, catchup, do fun things and eat delicious food together.

Before the month ended, my sister had her bachlorette party. I got to be the photographer. After taking photos and enjoying the food, the party started and we practiced dancing for the upcoming wedding.

### August

Although it started on a rough note with a family member passing away and having to travel to San Diego for the funeral. I did get to spend some time with my family and friends there. As well as follow it up with another trip to San Diego to attend my friend's wedding.

While in San Diego, I enjoyed a bonfire on the beach with friends as well as a couple more hangouts with more friends.

Another key heighlight was attending the Born Pink World Tour concert. It was a great experience and I got to see BlackPink perform live in my area! Not only we attended the concert but we attended the Lovesick pre party the day before.

### September
Started the month by relaxing a bit and doing a quick staycation on the strip in anticipation for the craziness and chaos of my sister's wedding. We enjoyed the OPM show at the cosmopolitan which was fun as well as the Linq Promonade!

After that I had to wrap up the legal settlement that our HOA is involved in. I managed to get the lawsuits settled as well as get our HOA $20,000 to cover some of our expenses.

The rest of the month was spent with the family preparing and celebrating my sister's wedding. It was a great experience and I am glad I got to be part of it and one of the groomsmen. We did the full celebration which included a henna party before the wedding and another party after the wedding.

### October
It was a rollercoaster of emotions! It started nice and easy. Work was calm and I matched with a nice girl and started dating. However, that didn't last long.

Work got crazier and some big changes happend which meant I had to step up and take on more responsibilities. Our chief product officer was changed with a new person who didnt start for two weeks later. I was in charge of making sure we didnt drop the ball anywhere within product or engineering. Once the new executive started I helped with onboarding and knowledge transfer. I officially became the Chief Archetict and was no in charge of the entire product and engineering teams by the end of the month. 

As for dating, I realized although the girl that I met was amazing and could have been perfect, she wasn't the one for me. So I ended things and decided to focus on myself, my career and pause dating till next year. I knew the rest of the year would be busy and chaotic and I needed to focus on that before I commit to starting a relationship.

I did also have a bit of fun. I watched Old Dads in theater before it was out with the family. I also got to enjoy a Postcard from earth in the new Las Vegas Sphere with my friend. Celebrated my sister's birthday and attended a family friend's wedding.

### November
We had relatives visit from San Diego, Denmark and Sweden which was fun. We got to hangout and catchup with them. We also got to explore the strip and downtown and enjoyed some shows and food.

I took an Aramic class to relearn the langauage and be able to read and write it. It was a great experience and I am glad I did it. Hopefully I won't forget it again and put to use.

Also before thanksgiving I got the opportunity to volunteer at the library to help feed the elderly. It was a fun and interesting experience! I worked as a waiter serving people and while doing so I got to learn some very interesting stories from them.

To wrap up the month, our CourseKey executive team had the annual planning session in Denver Colorado. Although it was nice seeing the team in person again, we didn't get to explore or enjoy the city.
