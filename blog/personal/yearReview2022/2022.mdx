### Crypto Taxes Software
Because I made many transactions and few trades in crypto last year, I needed to file taxes for it. I searched many online crypto tax software and none of them seemed to handle my complex use cases. I participated in ICO and invested in few tokens that have transitioned into thier own blockchains/coins. The ones that were able to handle it, had a redicules fee associated with using the software.

Being a software engineer, I decided to take things into my own hands and build a script to do all the calculations for me. I added alot of cool features on top of calculating the costbasis and generating a report for taxes. I added multiple costbasis algorithms to compare and analyze whichone will be best for my taxes reporting. I also generate the taxes forms, crypto dividents, summary of income as well as fully automated aggregator of transactions from all of the exchanges I use. Additionally, I am using the script to standarize all the data and save automatically save it into my crypto tracking sheet. 

This project took alot of reading and work. Here are just a few of the articles/websites I read to figure out how to calculate everything correctly and where most helpful:

### Golden Pothos
Since I set up my home office, I have been wanting to get a plant. It took me a while to research and figure out which plant I wanted. By the time I figured it out, I got sick with COVID and wasn't able to get it! However, once I was able to I got my Golden Pothos! To make sure it survives and thrives I did quite a bit of reading and got the [Blossom App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.conceptivapps.blossom&hl=en_US&gl=US).

- [Learn how to care for the Pothos!](https://www.thesill.com/blogs/plants-101/how-to-care-for-golden-pothos-epipremnum-aureum) Nice summary, same information can be found in the Blossom app
- [Do Pothos Need Fertilizer? (What Type, How Much & More)](https://simplifyplants.com/do-pothos-need-fertilizer/) Great guide about fertilizers in general!

## Reading Materials this year
This year I have been extremely bad at keeping track of my readings! This is due to the fact that most of my reading has been articles and newsletter online. I will be looking into a way to capture my reading material in a user friendly way.
