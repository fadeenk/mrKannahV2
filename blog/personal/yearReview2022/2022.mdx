## Goals achieved this year
###  Major Life goals
#### Develop a financial roadmap

### Yearly Goals
#### Increase my crypto investment

## Projects
### Crypto Taxes Software
Because I made many transactions and few trades in crypto last year, I needed to file taxes for it. I searched many online crypto tax software and none of them seemed to handle my complex use cases. I participated in ICO and invested in few tokens that have transitioned into thier own blockchains/coins. The ones that were able to handle it, had a redicules fee associated with using the software.

Being a software engineer, I decided to take things into my own hands and build a script to do all the calculations for me. I added alot of cool features on top of calculating the costbasis and generating a report for taxes. I added multiple costbasis algorithms to compare and analyze whichone will be best for my taxes reporting. I also generate the taxes forms, crypto dividents, summary of income as well as fully automated aggregator of transactions from all of the exchanges I use. Additionally, I am using the script to standarize all the data and save automatically save it into my crypto tracking sheet. 

This project took alot of reading and work. Here are just a few of the articles/websites I read to figure out how to calculate everything correctly and where most helpful:

- [2020 tax guide: crypto and Bitcoin in the U.S.](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/tips-and-tutorials/crypto-and-bitcoin-taxes-US)
- [The Ultimate Crypto Tax Guide: What You Need to Know Before April 15](https://cryptolawinsider.com/crypto-tax/)
- [Earn Interest on Crypto: The Taxes Guide](https://www.blog.cointracking.info/earn-interest-on-crypto-the-taxes-guide)
- [IRS: Frequently Asked Questions on Virtual Currency Transactions](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions)
- [How To Calculate Crypto Cost Basis: All You Need To Know About Tracking Cost Basis Across Wallets And Exchange](https://www.zenledger.io/blog/tracking-cost-basis-across-wallets-exchanges)

### Golden Pothos
Since I set up my home office, I have been wanting to get a plant. It took me a while to research and figure out which plant I wanted. By the time I figured it out, I got sick with COVID and wasn't able to get it! However, once I was able to I got my Golden Pothos! To make sure it survives and thrives I did quite a bit of reading and got the [Blossom App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.conceptivapps.blossom&hl=en_US&gl=US).

- [Learn how to care for the Pothos!](https://www.thesill.com/blogs/plants-101/how-to-care-for-golden-pothos-epipremnum-aureum) Nice summary, same information can be found in the Blossom app
- [Do Pothos Need Fertilizer? (What Type, How Much & More)](https://simplifyplants.com/do-pothos-need-fertilizer/) Great guide about fertilizers in general!

### Build a solid investment portfolio
I learned about the [Ichimoku Cloud](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ichimoku-cloud.asp) and I decided to use that method of analysis to build an investment protfolio. The reason why I started looking at more advanced technical analysis tools is because I managed to lose ~60% in individual stock picks in a market that was one of the most bullish markets. 

Also instead of spending time analyzing stocks and picking them individually. I found this [awesome guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jaBKXDqg9U) who has done all the things that I wanted and shared the [code too](https://github.com/derekbanas/Python4Finance)! I used that as the base for automating the analysis then I tweaked it some more.

First, I got a list of all of the nasdaq stocks instead of just the ones that were included. After that I pulled the entire daily stock trades data of those stocks in the last three years and calculated the returns for all of them. Taking all that data and processed it even further to calculate the Ichimoku cloud data.

Once I had all the data, I began filtering and building my protfolio. The first pass included focusing on top 2 preforming stocks in each sector that have had a strong positive momentum not just at the time of running the analysis but also within the last two weeks of trading and the last 100 days. Once the list was generated I had 12+ stocks to pick from which was still alot for me to research and decide on personally.

I ran millions of simulations of different [Markowitz Portfolio Optimizations (Modern Portfolio Theory)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp) to pick top performing portfolios that the lowest wieght of any individual stock is more or equal to 2%. Also while running the simulations I was also calculating and evaluating the [Sharpe ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) to help determine how much of each stock should be held in my porfolio.

Once I got the best stocks and weights for my portfolio, I calculated how much I need to invest and how many shares per stock I should get to build this portfolio. Here is the final results.

### Car upgrades
Although I am not driving as much, I decided to give my car a few upgrade. Last upgrade I did was when I replaced the entertainment system during the first COVID lockdown! One thing that I didn't like about my car was the fact that it didnt have LED lighting. So I bought and replaced all the lights in the car. I replaced the internal and external lights as well as the headlights.

Additionally, I got new tires! However, during the process the wheel covers were not installed correctly which caused one of the covers to fly away somewhere. I took the chance and I bought new cool wheel covers and replaced all of them.

// TODO take a picture of the lights

### My personal smart media center upgrades
Although the system was great there were some issues with it. I disliked how Plex worked and how it required my to have an account with them and restricted funtionality behind a pay wall. I decided to switch to a different service that I found that was free, easy to use and comes with ton of great feaures/plugins. I switched to [Jelleyfin](https://jellyfin.org/).

The system worked great after the changes and I was pretty happy till I got tired of sitting in my chair all day instead of laying down on my bed. So instead of getting a smartTV and mounting it on the wall, I got a projector. The projector was great since now I have way bigger screen and dont have to worry about drilling the walls.

Additionally, I set up a Distributed Transcoding System ([TDarr](https://tdarr.io/)) to transcode my media to a format that is easier to watch/stream on my TV. That way I can watch things without having to worry about buffering due to realtime transcoding. This was mainly a problem with content that is 4K and certain encodings, so I just stopped using them and removed the service to reduce the load on my PC.

### Professional video edit for my sister
Since I was the videographer/photographer for my sister's promising party. I took all the footage and edited it to make it look more professional and personal. To do so I dusted up my editing skills, got Adobe Premiere Pro and started editing the footage. I realized, I haven't edited anything in so long that I dont even remember how things worked. I found some basic tutorials followed by a few more advanced. My favorite tutorial was [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eDsvKwM40U) which I discovered a bit too late and wish would have found it before I was almost done with the whole project.

## Reading Materials this year
This year I have been extremely bad at keeping track of my readings! This is due to the fact that most of my reading has been articles and newsletter online. I will be looking into a way to capture my reading material in a user friendly way.

## Podcasts

### January
This year did not start on a good note... which seem like it is becoming a pattern. As I was still fighting COVID for the first couple weeks, I was still working. However, the work was fun work and it was full of meetings starting the new year and announcing the full year plan to the teams. We did the engineering team kickoff remotly because my team could not meet in person due to travel complications and the spread of OmiCron. Although, it was a remote kickoff it was still a great experince and got to enjoy a couple days of collaborating with the team and not worry about every day chaos and work.

After being qurantined for almost a month due to COVID, my family and I decided to celabrate by enjoying some nice food. We decided to do an all you can eat since this is a popular option in Las Vegas. We picked wicked spoon at the cosmopolitan, which was pretty good!

### February
Kicked off the month by doing a 3-day Agile trainning session with the team. This was a necessary thing to do as we wanted to optimize the teams performance before getting started to work on our big project for the year. The project kicked off and things did not go as planned. We ran into many issues with our systems getting overloaded and clients misconfigring. 

Since things started opening back up we started exploring more of Vegas! We went to SeaQuest, which was fun! We also explored some more casinos including [Silverton Mermaids Shows](https://silvertoncasino.com/hotel/aquarium-mermaids-shows/).


### March
I booked a vocation for May! February was rough and March was not any easier. March was challening in a different way. From losing managers and me assuming thier responsibilities to letting go of the oldest engineer on my team (been working on coursekey together for more than eight years).

With all the chaos, I needed a break and step away for a bit! I took a quick weekend in Austin! I got to hangout with Luke and meet up with a few awesome people who moved there. I also got to let off some steam the Texan way.

### April

My sister got promised and I got to be the videographer/photographer. We got to celebrate with family and start the month on a good note. Soon after we went to San Diego. It was a business and plesure trip. We filed our taxes, saw relatives and be tourists. We even spent half a day in Mexico.

After we got back we had to deal with jury duty for my Mom which was not fun. To offset it we went to America's got Telent live and we got to see some of the best shows and the winner of the latest season live! It was a great experince and worth every penny. My sister was picked to participate in Peter Antoniou's act which was cool!

The fun times didn't end when we got back home. It was back to work and day to day life. We had a conference coming up at the start of June, which meant the Luke was in town and it was time to have some fun.
