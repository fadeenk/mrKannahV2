Before jumping into 2019, I took a step back and did some self-reflection. As I took a deeper look into last year, I realized that 2018 has been one busy year. I ended up writing this because of how much has happened this year. As I was doing so, I realized I could just share it with everyone.

Before jumping into lessons learned and challenges from this year, I would like to first walk you through the big highlights of this year. The easiest way I could do that is if we turned this year into a movie.

If this year was a movie, it would be the equivalent of marvel‚Äôs infinity war. Just like the movie, this year had many stories clash together, other stories concluded, and a few new ones have started. In few words, this year has been busy, challenging, full of changes, old things, new things, lots of fun, lots of work, smiles, tears and it ended with a snap!

The year started with a house hunt. A hunt that had the whole family searching and hunting until my sister spotted our dream house! Once we set target, the process of closing started! The process was painful, and we would have not gotten the house if it wasn‚Äôt for the help of my uncle and cousin!

## The First Battles

Once we got the house key another battle started. The remodeling‚Ä¶ This battle lasted a few months. There were many upgrades needed, painting, installing tiles, installing lights, ceiling fans, upgrading the kitchen, installing synthetic grass and much more. However, by the end of all the upgrades I got to celebrate the house with my CourseKey family and friends!

Since the house purchase and the remodeling took a few months (4.5 months). I did not sit idly, I was engaged with few other things. For starters, I got to celebrate two of my cousins‚Äô engagement in January!

Couple days after the partying, I attended the developer week conference in Oakland! There I had a blast with my friends and coworkers. I got to play Settlers of Catan for the first time and I won! However, that might have been because I threatened Luan (CourseKey‚Äôs Android summa cum laude) that I would fire him üòù

My personal consulting business got some love! For starters, I upgraded the website. It is still work in progress and in need for a lot of improvements. Nonetheless it is still better than the previous version, which was nothing! My old website was taken down because I forgot to log in üòÖ. Additionally, I finally got my business license! Now, I am officially certified to do business in the city of El Cajon.

## The Summer Heat

<img style={{float: 'left', width: '400px', marginRight: '5px'}} src={sdsu} />

Once summer arrived, it brought its heat and fun. I went back to school, after taking four years break from SDSU to focus on CourseKey. I started with an online class then two classes during the fall. With that completed, I only have two classes left and I will officially graduate next year!

<div style={{clear: 'both'}} />

As we all know summer is the fun season! This year I decided to travel and explore with great and fun people. My first summer trip was my cousin‚Äôs bachelor party in Cancun! The trip cannot be summed in words!

I knew the trip would be great from the very start. On the way to Cancun we got a cheap upgrade to first class (for the first time ever!). We stayed at Riu Palace Las Americas (adult only) resort. Since I am on the ‚ÄúSee food diet‚Äù as you may already know, we did the all-inclusive food and drinks!

Although the hotel was great and offered many onsite entertainment and activities, we were not just going eat, drink, and enjoy the beach all day long. We went on a couple of excursions while we were in the area.

<YouTube videoId="Nui-tIvkt0Y" />

First stop was Tulum ruins. Tulum was amazing for many reasons! I was fascinated by how it was built and learning the history behind it. I got to see the temple of Ah Muzen Cab (One of my favorites ADCs in SMITE) and learn more about him.

Next stop was Cob√° the Mayan city, where I got to explore the ruins in a jungle. The most exciting part of this stop was climbing the Nohoch Mul Pyramid. Sadly, the pyramid was not in a great shape‚Ä¶ most steps were broken, and some had big pieces missing. However, that did not stop me from wanting to climb it!

<Gallery columns={3} photos={[
   { src: coba1, width: 4, height: 3 },
   { src: coba2, width: 4, height: 3 },
   { src: coba3, width: 2, height: 3 },

The climb was one of the scariest things I have done in a long time. What seemed like a simple climb was definitely not! The problem was not the broken steps or the height to speak of really. The issue was how many people were going up and down. Some of those people could not breath and looked like they could pass out any minute. When I reached the top the humidity and altitude hit me hard, I started having a bit of a hard time breathing and my glasses were fogging up nonstop. Finally, it starting to rain which did not help, going down was at the very least more than I asked for. However, the view from the top alone was worth the trouble.

Following that we made a stop at a small cenote. I went for a swim, it was refreshing and cold. The swim felt great, however floating was a challenge since it was fresh water. The water was extremely clear, you can see the fish swimming below you.

To wrap a busy day, we stopped at Playa del Carmen for the sun set and exploring a touristy part of Cancun. But wait something is missing‚Ä¶ where is the party? Well‚Ä¶ we did not go there to party really. We went there to enjoy a relaxing time and explore. For me I got to enjoy lots of food, drinks, sun and excursions. I got to try lots of awesome food and drinks. The main highlight would be the pina colada, miami vice and cannot forget the all you can eat, especially the churros!

Finally, before wrapping up the Cancun trip, we did stop at a club. You can‚Äôt really expect us to go to Cancun and not at least party once. The club was fun and had pretty good music.

Summer was not over and neither was its fun. Four days after coming back from Cancun, I was back in Mexico. This time was for business! I went to CourseKey‚Äôs Guadalajara headquarters. We met up with Chad‚Äôs (Alejandro) family, our QA engineer, and we got to spend friday working together.

Who are we kidding at this point? It is the weekend, we are in Guadalajara it was time to have a drink or two. We made lots of great memories together! Pancho (Ron) was a celebrity at the bar, everyone playing drinking games, and many many more fun memories.

Since we were in Guadalajara, we had to make a stop at Tequila town. We had a blast there and not just from drinking ridiculous amount of tequila. Downtown was great with all the shops and street food stands. We even enjoyed a tour inside Tequila Tres Mujeres.

You would think I have had a busy enough summer by now, well sorry to disappoint. I ended up on a four days cruise with the family to Ensenada and on the way stopped at Santa Ana Zoo.

As expected, the cruise was a blast. The main highlight for me was the unlimited ice cream (and all the other food of course)! I attended paintings auction and got to learn about the history of some of the artists as well as the way they protect their work against counterfeiting. Plus, I got to enjoy some shows aboard the cruise.

## The Fall wrap up

As fall started to settle in, many things were changing and shifting around. One notable shift was the office relocation and with that comes the new office warming party!

<Gallery photos={[
   { src: team1, width: 50, height: 35 },
   { src: team2, width: 50, height: 35 },

The party was a great excuse for me to do some networking and spend time with friends. I got to meet old and new friends as well as have a drink or two with them.

As the year was coming to an end, we celebrated one last hurrah! The Christmas party! Although this party didn‚Äôt actually involve too much partying, in my opinion it was one of the most memorable. Mainly due to the great time that everyone was having and all the fun honest late-night conversations.

<Gallery photos={[
   { src: team3, width: 60, height: 50 },
   { src: team4, width: 40, height: 50 },

After the party, things were settling down. As the dust was clearing and the year ending everything seemed quiet. Looking around, many people (close friends and acquaintances) were no longer there. Some old faces and new alike were beside me. With that I took a deep breath and reevaluated things as I prepare for 2019.

## Other notable moments of the year

### Exploring different cultures

In March, me and my sisters decided to attend the Korean cultural night since we enjoy K-pop, Korean dramas, and of course Korean food. The event included many singing, dancing, cultural music, Korean martial arts history, martial arts demonstrations and many more things.

### Enjoying the water & sun

This year my family and I purchased the yearly pass for SeaWorld. Since we had the pass, we went there so many times that no one knows the exact number. I have been on every single ride except for the electrical eel and the Sky Tower. I have seen all the different shows including the seasonal ones (summer, Halloween and Christmas). I have explored every corner reachable.

You cannot live in San Diego and not go to the beach during the summer. The best beach trips are those with the family and friends. Additionally, we have lots of great parks where you can still enjoy the sun, weather and without the crowd of people.

### Optimizing my workflows

Sometime around middle of the year I changed how I handle my tasks. I was always stressing about when I will get things done and what I have left todo. I had many places where I kept track of what I needed done, including my head (the worst place possible). I started using trello and following a process that I learned about from an opensource project maintainer‚Äôs youtube video. The new process has been a life saver.
