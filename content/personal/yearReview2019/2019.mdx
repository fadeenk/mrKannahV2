(AMP talk on 2/27)

Last year I did a year review and I really enjoyed reflecting back on it. I had decided that I will keep documenting each year's highlights. This year however I decided to do it slightly different! Instead of waiting till the new year and spending a week or so trying to remember all the information, I wrote things down as they were happening.

### January

The first exciting event of the year was game night at Luke's place. We played bunch of boardgames and it was ton of fun! Especially when me and Luke played the trading game XXXXXX. 

Couple weeks later my family and I decided to try a traditional Filipino meal. We tried the Fiesta Kamayan at the Villa Manila. The experience was great and the food was good except that it was way saltier than expected.

### February

We finally got our new backend engineer Tim!! The hiring for the role took over a quarter to find the right fit. Funny thing, we hired tim and literally two days later the whole dev team was leaving for the DevWeek conference. We had to stumble to get him a ticket and ask him to pay to attend since CourseKey could not afford to cover anything other than the tickets.

The CourseKey development and product teams attended the DevWeek conference in Oakland. We got to meet up with ex CourseKey engineer (Irving). It was a great time as we got to spend time together in addition to learning few things from the conference. Of course, we cannot forget about all the free dev swag that we got. 

The main highlight of the trip for me was at the end of the conference. It was when we learned about an issue in production and the dev team was hotfixing the issue as our PM decided to upgrade our JIRA causing a bit of confusion. Additionally, I got to get a discount for gitKraken software and reported all the bugs and issues to the PMs at attlasian regarding JIRA and bitbucket.

On the 25th of February, I learned that our first patent has been granted as of the 19th! We originally started working on the patent back in 2015 and had it filed in 2016. Being a patent holder was one of my nice to accomplish goals. Since this goal is already 0achieved, I replaced it with getting a second patent. Once is not enough for me and I already have the second one already filed and waiting for it to be granted. 

Since we moved offices at CourseKey, our agent got us a reservation to brew our own beer, We brew it in February and bottle it in March. This is becoming kind of a tradition as we move offices, we brew new beer. First time we brewed an IPL. This time we did something different (an American something something) more fruity and lighter so it is easier to drink.

### March

March was even busier! It started with my new website launch! I finally put together a website that includes its own blog. Medium was extremely annoying for me so since the beginning of the year, I rebuilt my website from ground up to allow me to do whatever I want. 

Couple days later, I found [the post that changed my life](). Soon after I attended the MESA leadership conference. I was hoping the conference would be similar to when I first attended in 2014. Here is [the recap of the conference]().

My website was not the only website launch that month. We also launched the new and updated CourseKey website. That included moving our website domain to [coursekey.com]() no `the` or `education`. just a simple domain. It took us a while to get the domain but we finally got it.

To wrap up March, My family and I went on a trip to Los Angeles. We got to spend two days at universal studios. Followed by a day in the Getty center and Villa. Although, univeral studios was great, I enjoyed the Getty meuusems way more. 

### April

April was eventful, literally! The first event, I attended was Enterpernurship orginazation's event for company acquisitions. This event was fun as I got to connect with other cofuonders and learn about the process of selling/buying companies.

The ASU GSV education conference happened early April. This conference is where I got to see Bill Gates speak back in 2015???. I did not attend this year either, due to my busy sechdule and everything going on. However, I still got to network with people, thanks to Luke who got me into a few after networking parties after the conference. I attended Kaplan's, Learn Capital's and Entangled's parties. To summerize the parties, lot of successful people, lots of great stories and awesome free food.

Also I learned about the Coronado flower show event which was nice. The best part about this event was the adjacent event the coronado annual book sale! The book sale was amazing you get to grab books in great condition for $1-$5. 

Additionally, we cannot forget about giving back. This year was my first time volunteering for the Annual Children's Book Party. It was a great experience, here is [the recap]().

To wrap up April's events and since [my university journey]() was coming to an end. I was invited to attend the graduation ceremonies for the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program.

### May

Since CourseKey won the San Diego Venture Group's Cool Companies award for the fourth time?, we were invited to table our company for many investors. This year Luke had a conflict, so I took over and did the tabling. Although I enjoyed it, I confirmed for sure that I dont want to be doing these kind of events that often. My voice literally cracked 4-6 times while I was speaking to people. I talked what felt like a week's worth in just few hours. On the plus side the view was amazing!

Also, May is the graduation season! Since I finally took my last two classes, I officially walked this may. To celebrate graduation me and my friends decided to go for Brazilian BBQ, however since we are always looking for a deal we decided to go to Mr. Pampas in Tijuana, Mexico. Although, we crossed the border we did not get the famous street tacos! This was upsetting for us, so we decided to go back and get tacos two days later. We went to the most famous taco place, Taqueria Franc.

Additionally, I got invited to my friend Nathan's book launch party. He published his book XXXXXX. I got to tour Sourcify's office and hangout with friends and made a few new ones. 

This year I decided to speak at San Diego Startup Week. After reviewing the agenda, I noticed a lack of technical content. I decided to present on a topic that would have helped CourseKey in the early stages. Here is [the full recap of my talk]().


### June

As Luke likes to say, your network is your networth. So I started June by attending a networking event hosted by SDSU alumna. Most attendees were graduates or people who work in the IT (Information Technology) and/or IMS (Information management system) industries.

I got to connect and hangout with some of my engineering friends from SDSU. We got together and did what engineers do... have fun the nerdy way! First, we played HAM Radio fox hunt in the big backyard of my friends place. Got to see homemade 3D printer, play around with a stirling engine, had lots of func conversations (how to make liquid oxygen, rocket fuel and so on...). Then wrapped it up with a round of homemade/engineered laser tag!

Additionally, June is the start of the first contact for the new students at SDSU. This includes the EOP program's first contact. This year I volunteered for EOP and assisted in the first contact event.

In the middle of the month, I finally received my diploma! Also I got invited to the Knights of Columbus Mar Toma Council Graduation party hosted by the Chaldean church in El Cajon.

After ten years, I finally attended the San Diego county fair in Del Mar. I got VIP (employee) access, which means I get in for FREE thanks to my friend who works there. Me and my friends got to enjoy the fair along with the food of course. We ended the day with an epic fully loaded FREE ice cream sundae. 

The weather in San Diego was not great! On the last day of the month, we finally got to use our Aquatica tickets. We got to enjoy the sun and the water.


### July

Early in the month, I traveled to Minnesota for work. I got to visit the Mall of America and enjoy some VR experiences. 

Once I was back from my trip, I continued focusing on my network. I set up my own CRM with hubspot (Which did not do what I needed so I replaced it with Airtable, which did not work either). Through out the month I reached out and got in touch with some people in my network starting with the CEO at CourseKey and followed by
- Software Engineer at Qualcomm
- Communication Engineer at Northrop
- CTO at Sourcify
- Scrum master at MalwareBytes
- Project Manager at Micro Focus (HP Enterprise)
- VP of Engineering at Sony
- Senior Software Engineer at Twilio (formally worked at Sony)
- Senior Software Architect/ VP of Engineering/ Tech lead at varies companies
- Senior Software Engineer at Japanese bank

### August 
Started the month by having a game night at Luke's new place. 

Soon after it was vocation time! Last year my family and I enjoyed our cruise to Ensenada that we decided to do it again. However this time we took the rest of the family not just my immediate family.

After the cruise, we went to Los Angeles. Fist stop there was universal studios, followed by Korean BBQ, a walk in Hollywood main street and wrapped up with a the museum of illusions.

Finally before the month ended, we celebrated [CourseKey's fundraising](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2019-07-31-coursekey-raises-5-million-to-digitize-the-college-classroom?fbclid=IwAR1rcIyqOuT9ANl7LCENqRgDjKaAt7q4h_YYEJhmAJRv8ctWfaQKCyjVvRo) by doing a San Diego Cruise followed by some bar hopping and games.
