## Year Summary
Last year I did a year review and I really enjoyed reflecting back on it. I had decided that I will keep documenting each year's highlights. This year however I decided to do it slightly different! Instead of waiting till the new year and spending a week or so trying to remember all the information, I wrote things down as they were happening. You can read the month by month highlights or skip to the summary section below.

## Month by month breakdown
### January

The first exciting event of the year was game night at Luke's place. We played bunch of boardgames and it was ton of fun! Especially when me and Luke played the trading card game [Jaipur](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54043/jaipur). 

Couple weeks later my family and I decided to try a traditional Filipino meal. We tried the Fiesta Kamayan at the Villa Manila. The experience was great and the food was good except that it was way saltier than expected.

### February

We finally got our new backend engineer Tim!! The hiring for the role took over a quarter to find the right fit. Funny thing, we hired tim and literally two days later the whole dev team was leaving for the DevWeek conference. We had to stumble to get him a ticket and asked him to pay for flight and airbnb! (CourseKey could not afford to cover anything other than the tickets)

The CourseKey development and product teams attended the DevWeek conference in Oakland. We got to meet up with ex CourseKey engineer (Irving). It was a great time as we got to spend time together in addition to learning few things from the conference. Of course, we cannot forget about all the free dev swag that we got. 

The main highlight of the trip for me was at the end of the conference. It was when we learned about an issue in production and the dev team was hotfixing the issue as our PM decided to upgrade our JIRA causing a bit of confusion. Additionally, I got to get a discount for gitKraken software and reported all the bugs and issues to the project managers at Attlasian regarding JIRA and BitBucket.

On the 25th of February, I learned that our first patent has been granted as of the 19th! We originally started working on the patent back in 2015 and had it filed in 2016. Being a patent holder was one of my life goals to accomplish. Since this goal is already achieved, I replaced it with getting a second patent. Once is not enough for me and I already have the second one already filed and waiting for it to be granted. 

Since I was back at SDSU, I decided to be a bit more involved and attend the interesting events. I learned about Aztec Mentorship Program and decided to attend the talk/networking event. I got to meet few mentors and I decided to shadow one of them. This was my first step working on a long term goal.

Since we moved offices at CourseKey back in October of last year, our agent got us a reservation to brew our own beer. We brew it in February and bottle it in March. This is becoming kind of a tradition as we move offices, we brew new beer. First time we brewed an IPL. This time we did something different (an American something something) more fruity and lighter so it is easier to drink.

### March

March was even busier! It started with my new website launch! I finally put together a website that includes its own blog. Medium was extremely annoying for me so since the beginning of the year, I rebuilt my website from ground up to allow me to do whatever I want. 

Couple days later, I found [the post that changed my life](). Soon after I attended the MESA leadership conference. I was hoping the conference would be similar to when I first attended in 2014. Here is [the recap of the conference]().

My website was not the only website launch that month. We also launched the new and updated CourseKey website. That included moving our website domain to [coursekey.com]() no "the" or "education". just a simple CourseKey. It took us a while to get the domain but we finally got it.

To wrap up March, My family and I went on a trip to Los Angeles. We got to spend two days at universal studios. Followed by a day in the Getty center and Villa. Although, univeral studios was great, I enjoyed the Getty museums way more. 

### April

April was eventful, literally! The first event, I attended was Entrepreneurship organization's event for company acquisitions. This event was fun as I got to connect with other founders and learn about the process of selling/buying companies.

The ASU GSV education conference happened early April. This conference is where I got to see Bill Gates speak back in 2015???. I did not attend this year either, due to my busy schedule and everything going on. However, I still got to network with people, thanks to Luke who got me into a few networking after parties after the conference. I attended Kaplan's, Learn Capital's and Entangled's parties. To summarize the parties, there were lot of successful people, lots of great stories and free food!

Also I learned about the Coronado flower show event which was nice. The best part about this event was the adjacent event the coronado annual book sale! The book sale was amazing you get to grab books in great condition for $1-$5. 

Additionally, we cannot forget about giving back. This year was my first time volunteering for the Annual Children's Book Party. It was a great experience, here is [the recap]().

To wrap up April's events and since [my university journey]() was coming to an end. I was invited to attend the graduation ceremonies for the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) and the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program.

### May

Since CourseKey won the San Diego Venture Group's Cool Companies award for the fourth time?, we were invited to table our company for investors. This year Luke had a conflict, so I took over and did the tabling. Although I enjoyed it, I confirmed for sure that I dont want to be doing these kind of events that often. My voice literally cracked 4-6 times while I was speaking to people. I talked what felt like a week's worth in just few hours. On the plus side the view was amazing!

Also, May is the graduation season! Since I finally took my last two classes, I officially walked this may. To celebrate graduation me and my friends decided to go for Brazilian BBQ, however since we are always looking for a deal we decided to go to Mr. Pampas in Tijuana, Mexico. Although, we crossed the border we did not get the famous street tacos! This was upsetting for us, so we decided to go back and get tacos two days later. We went to the most famous taco place, Taqueria Franc.

Additionally, I got invited to my friend Nathan's book launch party. He published his book [Ecommerce Millionaires](https://www.amazon.com/Ecommerce-Millionaires-Underground-Playbook-Eight-Figure/dp/0578402920). I got to tour Sourcify's office and hangout with friends and made a few new ones. 

This year I decided to speak at San Diego Startup Week. After reviewing the agenda, I noticed a lack of technical content. I decided to present on a topic that would have helped CourseKey in the early stages. Here is [the full recap of my talk]().


### June

As Luke likes to say, your network is your networth. So I started June by attending a networking event hosted by SDSU alumna. Most attendees were graduates or people who work in the IT (Information Technology) and/or IMS (Information management system) industries.

I got to connect and hangout with some of my engineering friends from SDSU. We got together and did what engineers do... have fun the nerdy way! First, we played HAM Radio fox hunt in the big backyard of my friends place. Got to see homemade 3D printer, play around with a stirling engine, had lots of fun conversations (how to make liquid oxygen, rocket fuel and so on...). Then wrapped it up with a round of homemade/engineered laser tag!

Additionally, June is the start of the first contact for the new students at SDSU. This includes the EOP program's first contact. This year I volunteered for EOP and assisted in the first contact event.

In the middle of the month, I finally received my diploma! Also I got invited to the Knights of Columbus Mar Toma Council Graduation party hosted by the Chaldean church in El Cajon.

After ten years being in San Diego, I finally attended the San Diego county fair in Del Mar. I got VIP (employee) access, which means I get in for FREE thanks to my friend who works there. Me and my friends got to enjoy the fair along with the food of course. We ended the day with an epic fully loaded FREE ice cream sundae. 

The weather in San Diego had not been great! On the last day of the month, we finally got to use our Aquatica tickets. We got to enjoy the sun and the water.


### July

Early in the month, I traveled to Minnesota for work. I got to visit the Mall of America and enjoy some VR experiences. 

Once I was back from my trip, I continued focusing on my network. I set up my own CRM with hubspot (Which did not do what I needed so I replaced it with Airtable, which did not work either). Through out the month I reached out and got in touch with some people in my network starting with the CEO at CourseKey and followed by
- Software Engineer at Qualcomm
- Communication Engineer at Northrop
- CTO at Sourcify
- Scrum master at MalwareBytes
- Project Manager at Micro Focus (HP Enterprise)
- VP of Engineering at Sony
- Senior Software Engineer at Twilio (formally worked at Sony)
- Senior Software Architect/ VP of Engineering/ Tech lead at varies companies
- Senior Software Engineer at Japanese bank

### August 
Started the month by having a game night at Luke's new place. 

Soon after it was vocation time! Last year my family and I enjoyed our cruise to Ensenada so much that we decided to do it again. However this time we took the rest of the family not just my immediate family.

After the cruise, we went to Los Angeles. Fist stop there was universal studios, followed by Korean BBQ, a walk in Hollywood main street and wrapped up with a the museum of illusions.

Finally before the month ended, we celebrated [CourseKey's fundraising](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2019-07-31-coursekey-raises-5-million-to-digitize-the-college-classroom?fbclid=IwAR1rcIyqOuT9ANl7LCENqRgDjKaAt7q4h_YYEJhmAJRv8ctWfaQKCyjVvRo) by doing a San Diego Cruise followed by some bar hopping and games.

### September
The month where I got to spend my time with old and new friends. It started with Korean BBQ with Luke, this time a different spot! Those dinners are always great, since we finally get to catchup and have conversions about things other than work (work is still involved but at least it is not the only thing we talk about).

A couple days later, by some miracle, me and a group of my highschool friends got together for dinner. After finishing our dinner and we were ready to leave we ran into another friend in the parking lot and ended up hanging out for hours!

After four and a half years, Ming, our original CourseKey backend engineer, was finally back with the team! Ming is one of the core members who helped start CourseKey and his name is on the patent.

Another highschool/college group of friends decided to get together. This time we went to the famus [Grand Ole BQQ](https://flinnsprings.grandolebbq.com/). It was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. The food was good just it was not a good idea for dinner.
 
The next day I got to go on a boat! Nathan invited me and Luke to join him and his CTO and friend on a private boat. It was great time! We got to go really really fast, jump into the ocean for a swim, I got to drive the boat for a bit and enjoyed the company. Sadly, most of the pictures we took got lost.

Since, some of my highschool friends were considering doing graduate school. It peaked my interest. I want to keep learning and getting better, so I started investigating doing an MBA. At the same time, another friend at SDSU invited me to the Graduate Student Association event at Aztec Lanes. I snuck into the event (graduate students only) and asked about the program. I learned that it will not be the path for me, especially after talking to other executives in my network.

Again another highschool group got together! This time we did a bonfire at the beach, the weather was perfect for it. We enjoyed great conversations and lots of through backs. From playing highschool time music to playing old cartoon intro songs in arabic!

Before the month ended, I got an invite for Middle Eastern Student Union @ SDSU bonfire. I attended the event and it was nice to meet new people. However, the weather was not great (it started raining). Additionally, it was bad timing for me so I had to leave earlier than I would have liked.

### October
Was another busy month for me! It started with a nice catch up while a couple rounds of pool with a friend. Then I attended and volunteered for the Aztec Mentor Program (AMP). There I met an ambiguous student who has an interesting background with similar passions to mine. I decided to take him in as my mentee and I started working on my career and personal development online course.

While I was at San Diego State University for the AMP event, my friend told me about an event going on in the ZIP Launchpad so I stopped by. There I got to see the new startups going through the program and I realized the needed help and I could help them. So I started talking with the director to set something up.

I attended the Launch scale conference for startup founders. There I learned quite a bit about all sort of things, you can find the recap [here](). The main highlight of the trip for me was getting dinner at [the battery](https://www.thebatterysf.com/) with an extremely talented and interesting CEO. I got to listen to Luke and the CEO go at it while I enjoyed the beyond burger for the first time.

Soon after I got back from the conference, we learned that CourseKey is one of the [top tech employers in San Diego](). I judged a ZIP Lanuch pad pitchfest competition for a business organization. We (Coursekey) ran our first virtual summit all in the same week. Which meant we deserved a nice happy hour celebration after work.

Eventhough, I kept myself busy with all the things going on I still got to grow my professional network. I met up with a CTO of a very successful company in San Diego at the University Club atop symphony towers. The conversation was great, learned alot, the food was great and the view was amazing!

Through my increased involvement in the ZIP Launchpad, Luke and I met up with a team that has potential to become a successful business. We provided them with advise and feedback, gave them lessons we learned and the mistakes we made in hopes that they take the knowledge we give them and apply it to create a successful business.

Although it was a busy month that did not mean I did not get to enjoy it! I attended a beach birthday party where I somehow ended up in charge of barbecuing (for a bit). I spend more time with some fiends by walking on the beach at night. And to wrap up the month, I got to celebrate halloween a couple times. Once with the family in El Cajon where we enjoyed a spooky car show and events. Another, at work where I got to try delicious homemade spooky cupcakes and enjoy the elaborate customs of some coworkers. Finally had to say goodbye to Ming as he is traveling around before going back to Tokoyo to work for CourseKey full time.

### November
I started the month with spending some time with friends from getting food and eating out to just meeting up at starbucks and complaining about school/homework all over again. I met up with highschool/college friends for coffee followed by Mr. Shawarma. The next day was our (Luke and I) traditional Korean BBQ date. The following day was shopping day with me and another friend at Fry's Electronics and wrapped up that week with a nice dinner with a close friend who haven't seen in almost a year at Din Tai Fung.

During this month I officially become a technical adviser for the startups at the ZIP Launchpad.


## Summary

This year has been both challenging and rewarding! 

At CourseKey we have built and shipped our biggest releases ever! We had two massive releases that changed how the system works entirely! The first big release was our ground work that transitioned our system to an Accounting based attendance (record keeping approach to attendance). The second massive release was the revamp of our adjustment/correction system where we created a wizard for the user to use along with a whole new set of features to solve pain points they were experiencing.

With all those challenges we experienced a major growth. We got awarded our first patent. We were recognized as one of the 2019 Cool Companies by San Diego Venture Group. Additionally, we were recognized as one of the top tech employers in San Diego by Hired. We have doubled our campus wide adoptions year over year in the last three years. We have raised $5 million series A. We did our first industry focused virtual summit.

Balancing life, work and learning! This has been one of the biggest issues that I have faced. The thing about balancing my time is that each section has so many different things that fall under it that figuring out the best approach to handling it all is not an easy feat. For example, in my life there are so many things going on from family, friends, relationships, health, finances and so on. Work has me pulled into 100 different directions, from different projects, management, development, hiring, scaling, maintaining, security, mentoring and so on. Finally learning... the most broad problem! There is so much to learn that there is not enough time to absorb it all.

I would love to say that I have figured out how to balance everything but the truth is, I still got no clue on how to do that. The best thing that has helped me was defining a process for handling things and understanding the value of my time. First, having a process with everything going on. It is extremely easy for things to slip through especially when interacting with a lot of people. That is why I have evolved my workflow process to use the "Getting things done" methodology. I also have cleaned up my Trello board and reorganized it so it is no longer overwhelming. I tried creating a personal contact management system put that was more complicated than anticipated and decided I would tackle this project later. Second, understanding the value of my time. After reading Your Money or Your Life, I have a different perspective not just on money but also on life in general. The book made me reexamine how I spend my time which to me is the most valuable I have.

Although things been crazy, I still got to enjoy majority of my time. I got to travel with family and friends, try need food/places and build amazing technology. Throughout the spring, fall and spring almost every weekend I spend it out with either family or friends which meant when I got a weekend with no action it felt amazing! After taking a vocation with the family during the summer, I literally needed a vocation from the vocation because the exhaustion had caught up to me. Now, whenever I feel tired, I just dial things down a bit and take things a bit slower. 

### Goals achieved this year
####  Major Life goals 
- Become an engineer
- Earn a patent

#### Yearly Goals
- Have a better understanding of my financial situation
  - Create budgets and monitor spending
  - Educate myself on money, spending, investing and so on...
  - Evaluate and track networth
- Grow professionally
  - Grow my technical network (connect with two senior level people)
  - Grow my executive network (connect with two executive level people)
  - Become a better CTO
    - Continue to learn and develop my technical skills
    - Keep up with the technical podcasts
    - Educate myself
- Work on side projects
  - Github Actions: Create actions to help automate my open source projects
  - Automate testing and releasing of my open source packages: All my "maintained" packages now have an automated countinous integration and deployment built using github actions including updating. Whenever a dependency changes, I press one button and the process automatically updates, tests, bundles and releases it.
  - Create blog using gatsby: After using medium for a while, I disliked it because it could not handle complex long posts. Additionally, with all the new pay walls they are adding I decided I could do it better so this is why I created my blog.
  - Contacts management system: used pipedrive, hubspot, airtable then decided to build my own which I postponed for now)
  - Setup automated smart backup using Azure: Having a backup drive at home is good but not good enough for me. There is a lot of risk with having the backup in once place. So to protect it, I set up and automated system that encrypts and backs up all my data not only to the backup drive but also to the cloud.  
  - Setup automated smart media center using docker: I wanted to play around with multi-services architecture and learn how far I can push it on my computer. Apparently pretty far... The system is set up to track any movie or tv show. When it becomes available it automatically searches the internet and downloads it in the quality I set it to. Once downloaded, it automatically finds both English and Arabic subtitles and it updates the media server. The media server makes it all available for streaming on any smart device in my network. 
  - Create personal and career development course (WIP): This is something I wanted to do since I was in college. I often run into people who are exceptional just don't have a direction or dont know what they should be doing. Because of that I got into mentoring, however that is not scalable. This is why I started putting together a course to share the knowledge and information with as many people as possible.
- Improve my communication skills
  - Become better at confrontations
  - Communicate my thoughts better
  - Eliminate misunderstandings
- Be selfish with my time!
