product -> apis (makes apis a second class citizen)
apis -> product makes things easy to open up to the public

future proof apis
do things that dont scale first (help and learn from the customer before scaling and becoming hands off)


dont want data
they want workflows and actions, defined process
define benefits and approaches for customers
treat it like a product (do user interview, ensure documentation are accurate provide training) 

Time to first API call... (Meteric to measure integration experiance)
Find the right partners to help build the platform (expose the apis)

Integration is not about checking the box, it is how trully integrated and connected
