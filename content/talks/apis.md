APIs
- build apis to have data names match business logic
-- name is it userName, businessName and so on... instead nest data as user and business and inside of it

- Research competitive for things to expect for the apis

Focus on the costumer for the apis which is the developers

Dev workflow
- need credutional, docs, access
- see picture

### developer focused documentation
- All docs should be online
- use swagger for documentation and diff each update/version
- making it interactive


- pick your way to scale
- flexible design
- api should be for both human and machines
- support the customers
