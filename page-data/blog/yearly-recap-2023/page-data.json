The exercises in day each vary depending on the muscle focus and what machines are available, as well as I plan on changing them every few months to not get bored from doing the same thing every time. However, you will notice I have an extra day for core and cardio. That is because I want to make sure I am actually healthy and not muscular! Given my sedentary lifestyle, I use one day to make sure I get the blood flowing and the heart pumping real good. I even do 10 minutes of cardio each day as a warm-up before working out. As for the core, I had none... so I needed to build some muscle there and improve my balance and flexibility. Finally, you will notice I have forearm exercises sprinkled in on each day. That is because I reach failure because of my forearms instead of the actual muscles I am training.
